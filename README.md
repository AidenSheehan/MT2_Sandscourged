## Overview

***Deep within Limbo, a strange force is emerging, unlike anything Heaven has ever seen...***

The Sandscourged are a fully featured clan with two champions, a complete set of cards and artifacts, and several brand new mechanics! It's designed to feel like a natural extension of the vanilla game.

The Sandscourged are a clan with a focus on:

* Blights and Scourges
* Sacrificing Units
* Applying Debuffs
* Discarding Cards

It introduces two new Debuffs; Hex and Warp, and a new trigger; Accursed. Many thanks to [Brandon](https://github.com/TricksterGuy) from the [Conductor](https://github.com/Monster-Train-2-Modding-Group/Conductor) project for their help with developing these new additions!

**Note: This mod is in Beta. There's missing art, but all the gameplay and lore text is implemented. All existing art has been manually created by me, I intend to touch up some of the rougher art later <3.**

**IMPORTANT: This is a non-cosmetic mod. Do not play Daily Challenges with this mod installed, you'll get banned. Also, F8 bug reports are disabled, they won't go anywhere.**

## Excerpts
Here are some sample cards from the mod, to showcase what the clan's all about!

### Dependencies
Make sure you've installed all the dependencies before using the mod. This mod requires:

* [BepInEx-BepInExPack](https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/BepInEx)
* [MT2-Trainworks_Reloaded](https://github.com/Monster-Train-2-Modding-Group/Trainworks-Reloaded)
* [Conductor](https://github.com/Monster-Train-2-Modding-Group/Conductor)

For each dependency, follow the installation instructions listed there.

### This Mod
Once you've installed all the dependencies, copy this mod (unzipped) into your plugins directory. The file path should look something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Monster Train 2\BepInEx\plugins`.

## Bugs and Feedback
This mod is in beta. As such, you may come across bugs. If you do, [please report them here](https://github.com/AidenSheehan/MT2_Sandscourged/issues).

If you would like to give feedback on the mod (please do!), fill in [this google form](https://forms.gle/fL7YDzpHRxnQ9mtA8).

Any issues, contact me on the [Monster Train 2 Discord channel](https://discord.gg/jfbTdktH) (@All_Outta_Bubblegum).

### Known Issues
* The clan completion is offscreen in the logbook. This isn't going to be fixed until the new clan is added in the official DLC.
* Character art appears too dark in battle, and can clip between floors. This is an issue with the modding framework, not this mod per se.
* The unit banners don't update their sprite. Again, this is actually an issue with the framework. Art has been created for each banner state, they just aren't loaded correctly.
* On rare occasion, opening the logbook may cause a softlock. Root cause of this issue is unknown, so if it happens to you, please send me a message with the log file.
