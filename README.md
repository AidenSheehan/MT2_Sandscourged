## Overview

***Deep within Limbo, a strange force is emerging, unlike anything Heaven has ever seen...***

The Sandscourged are a fully featured clan with two champions, a complete set of cards and artifacts, and several brand new mechanics!

The Sandscourged are a clan with a focus on:

* Blights and Scourges
* Unit Sacrifice
* Applying Debuffs
* Discarding Cards

It introduces two new Debuffs; Hex and Warp, and a new trigger; Accursed. Many thanks to [Brandon](https://github.com/TricksterGuy) from the [Conductor](https://github.com/Monster-Train-2-Modding-Group/Conductor) project for their help with developing these new additions!

**Note: This mod is in Beta. There's missing art and lore text, but all the gameplay is implemented. All existing art has been manually created by me, I intend to touch up some of the rougher art later <3.**

**IMPORTANT: This is a non-cosmetic mod. Do not play Daily Challenges with this mod installed, you'll get banned. Also, F8 bug reports are disabled, they won't go anywhere.**

## Exerts
Here are some sample cards from the mod, to showcase what the clan's all about!
